# A

If "li" command has op code "001" then:
`RR $r` is the same with `li <($r register address = 2^2) + (funct = 2)>` = `li 6`

# B

A single R-Format opcode "contains" (can be used) 4 commands due to the "funct"
which is 2 bits long.

We can't have more than 4 r-format commands as we have no more available bits

So the commands will be:

> op=000 funct=00

> op=000 funct=01

> op=000 funct=10

> op=000 funct=11

# C

0---- \----\
       \    \
1------ \AND \-----+--------- I-Format
       /     /     |    \-----\
2---- /-----/      +---- \ NOT \ ------ R-Format
                         /-----/

R-Format Commands:

> op=000 funct=00

> op=000 funct=01

> op=000 funct=10

> op=000 funct=11

> op=001 funct=00

> op=001 funct=01

> op=001 funct=10

> op=001 funct=11
The reason is because `beq` and `bne` are R-format commands already, so adding
another immediate would be out of the 32 bit limit.
